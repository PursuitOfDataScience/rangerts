This is a subdirectory for test with the M-series competition data sets (M3 and M4) to compare the standard random forest with its variants of block bootstrap.

All scripts are in the scripts/ subdirectory, to be executed in order from 0 to 2, to reproduce the same result as shown in the compiled html file. The script 0 installs the necessary dependencies, the script 1 carries out experiments and saves results in an rds format (as in the results/ subdirectory), and the script 2 performs analysis (the same as shown in the html file).
